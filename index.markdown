### They call me DevOps

I am quite lazy and I tend to forget everything, so, that inevitablely drove me to automation and writing things as code. And that is what I have been doing for about twelve years now. Apparently, I am not the only one, and people like me are called DevOps. But I preffer to say that we are system administrators that embrace DevOps culture.


### Moar Tech!

On previous versions of this website, I had this fancy list of technologies I have used enough to be able to say I knew them. The list keept growing as technology and necessity did and it became way too large. So I just decided to stop this suffering today.

Lately I have been mostly working on Cloud, but I have seen places in my past, even Datacenters:
* Mostly [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}, but I also used [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} on my HEAD^1 job.
* I had the pleasure to experience something called [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://run.pivotal.io/){:target="_blank"} too.

My first contact with infrastructure as code was [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation){:target="_blank"}, but, like few relationships, it ended up in good terms and I mostly use [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){:target="_blank"} now.

And yes, I know a couple things about config management:
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/){:target="_blank"} and it's idempotencies.
* [Puppet](https://puppet.com/){:target="_blank"}, we all had a first love, right?

And everything else:
* All the monitoring and graphs: the oldies, the [Nagios](https://www.nagios.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [Icinga](https://icinga.com/){:target="_blank"}, the [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/){:target="_blank"}; new ones, the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){:target="_blank"}, the [fluentd's](https://www.fluentd.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Grafanas](https://grafana.com/){:target="_blank"}; the expensive ones, [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [Newrelics](https://newrelic.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc.
* Continuous integration, deployment and delivery: [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Go-CD](https://www.gocd.org/){:target="_blank"} (Yes, I have used it), [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo){:target="_blank"}, etc.
* Logs! [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/es/what-is/elk-stack){:target="_blank"}, EFK...
* All the Databases, SQL, noSQL... but Oracle, LOL. You name it.

I didn't mention [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Helm](https://helm.sh/){:target="_blank"}. But that was on purpose. Wait...

This list has gone way too large again, is not possible to shrink it... If you are curious, just ask me, I am on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eltioemil){:target="_blank"}.

Oh, I almost forgot, I also have experienced the joys of being [manager](./assets/Douglas_Reynholm.jpg){:target="_blank"} and tech lead.
