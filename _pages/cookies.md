This site does not store any tracking, functional, metrics, marketing, `whatever` cookies. The only cookie this site stores is the one that tracks that you accepted the cookie message. The Cookieception. The only purpose of that cookie is stop showing the cookie message, which can be pretty annoying.

### Why I don't want cookies?

I wanted this site to be as static as it could be, this is also why it does not accept comments.

If you need to comment or point out something about this blog I can be contacted through my [`Linkedin`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliourena){:target="\_blank"}. I don't like anonymous comments either, so, if you need to tell me anything I expect you to properly identify yourself through Linkedin or at the least I expect you to have the decency to expend a little time creating a fake profile.

Cheers!
