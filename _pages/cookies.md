## A word about cookies

This site stores 2 functionality cookies on your machine. The first cookie is the cookie consent banner cookie, which stores that you clicked `Got it` or not in the banner. Which is kinda a Cookieception, I might say.

Second one is somehow "optional". It's a third party cookie. If you never use comments, that cookie will not be generated. But if you log into Github in order to comment, a session token cookie will be stored in so your session is saved for future access. If you don't want this cookie to be stored, you can use your browser capability to block all third-party cookies on my site (or in every site), this way, every time you enter a post, you will be prompted to log into Github and this cookie will never be stored.

Quite easy, right?
