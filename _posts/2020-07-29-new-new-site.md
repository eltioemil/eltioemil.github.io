I got tired of the original site based on minima theme, so  I decided to modify a [`quite nice and clean template that I found which is called Tale`](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale){:target="_blank"}. But I added some features that I had in the old one, changed some tiny details and I am sure I will be changing more in the future.

I wanted to change and give posts more protagonism, so I decided to land in the post section and then, if someone is interested on my resume, they can just navitage to about.

At this point I don't know if anyone reads me or I am just writing to me, but, that works either. I might add some categories to not just write about technology, I will meditate about that.
